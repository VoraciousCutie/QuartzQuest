# QuartzQuest
An mlp themed vorish rpg - completely client side for github pages!

The plan is to have the game be procedurally generated like Minecraft or a rogue-like, but have a branching and unique story each playthrough!
It will be mostly text-based, but will have full character customization that describes your pone in real time in the action.
The world map, cities, towns, dungeons, npcs, and even the main questline will be randomly generated (likely from an initial world seed if I can figure out how that works)!
Combat will most likely be inspired by 5e D&D, and will contain a vore system to get your kicks!

Of course, expect all the fun vorish clitches! Unwilling, endo, digestion, weight gain, trophies, reformation! You name it! ~

## WIP
This is a work in progress and for now it's mostly a placeholder as I tinker around in the back-end.
The feature-list above is vast, and I have outlandish ideas that may never come to fruition...
Keep your hopes high and expectations low, this is a passion project after all!
That said, I'd like to make something really special here, so...
Wish me luck!!
